## Schema

### Required

- `entra_group` (String) The name of the Entra Group to assign to the Role
- `role_name` (String) The name of the Role to assign the Entra Group to

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Identifier for the Entra Group System Role assignment. Currently, as we do not get a unique ID we can use from the API, ID is set by combining the role name and the Entra group name, with a pipe symbol as separator: RoleName|EntraGroupName
